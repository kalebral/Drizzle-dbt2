To build and run with Drizzle, run the following steps:

1. Build the tools
	 % rm -f CMakeCache.txt
	 % cmake CMakeLists.txt -DDB="drizzle" && make

2. Generate the data, specifying the number of warehouses with the -w option and the location of where to store the generated data.

	% ./bin/dbt2-datagen -w 10  -d /tmp/data --drizzle

3. Load the data into the database (assumes you have a version of drizzled already running) specifying the path of the generated data and the path to the drizzle client

	% ./bin/drizzle/dbt2-drizzle-load-db --path /tmp/data --drizzle_path <path to drizzle client>

4. Set your path accordinglyl and then run the test and generate test results

	% export PATH=$PATH:<dbt2 repository>/bin:<dbt2 repository/bin/drizzle
	% chmod +x ./bin/drizzle/dbt2-drizzle-run
        % mkdir -p /tmp/dbt2
	% ./bin/drizzle/dbt2-drizzle-run --connections 10 --time 300 --warehouses 10 --output-base /tmp/dbt2 --host 127.0.0.1

Output should look similar to:

25.86 new-order transactions per minute (NOTPM)
1.9 minute duration
0 total unknown errors
2 rollback transactions
3 second(s) ramping up

NOTE: Make sure that number of warehouses (option -w) is less of equal (not
greater) to the number of warehouses that were created when you generated your
data

Results and log files can be found in <output dir>/output/<number>

Some of the useful log files:

  <output dir>/output/<number>/client/error.log - client errors
  <output dir>/output/<number>/driver/error.log - driver errors
  <output dir>/output/<number>/driver/mix.log - info about performed transactions
  <output dir>/output/<number>/driver/statistics.out - results of the test
